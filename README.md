It includes the Mobile App for user interaction, the Caching Service for data retrieval efficiency, and the Local Database for offline data persistence. These components interact with the External Weather API to provide real-time weather updates and forecasts for touring bands.*


## Why Offline-First?

In a world where connectivity can be inconsistent, an offline-first approach ensures that your application remains reliable. We prioritize local data processing and storage, so users can access core features without a hitch. When a connection is available, the app syncs and updates seamlessly.

## Get Started:

To get started with RockW, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions. Your journey towards a more reliable, user-friendly offline experience begins here!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andermelo/rock_w.git
cd rock_w
```

```

### Using Melos [Optional]

This project utilizes [Melos](https://melos.invertase.dev/getting-started) to facilitate command management. If you wish to use Melos, follow the steps below:

```bash
dart pub global activate melos
melos bootstrap
```

To run tests using Melos:

```bash
melos test
```

Other available Melos commands in the project's melos.yaml:

- `analyze`: Runs `flutter analyze` on all Flutter packages.
- `analyze:all`: Performs analysis on all packages without selection.
- `generate:all`: Runs file generation on all packages.
- `generate`: Runs file generation on Flutter packages only.
- `test:all`: Runs all tests and generates HTML coverage reports.
- `test`: Runs tests on all Flutter packages.
- `coverage`: Generates HTML coverage reports from existing lcov data.
- `coverage:view`: Opens the HTML coverage report in the default browser.
- `lint`: Runs the Dart analyzer on all packages.
- `format`: Formats all Dart files in the repository.

If you want to generate and view the HTML report without Melos, run this in the terminal:

```bash
flutter test --coverage
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
open coverage/html/index.html
```
